    <h1>Welcome! Before you start, it might be helpful to be briefly introduced [smiley face]</h1>
    <p> This is a lyric guessing game! You can choose a song of your choice by searching or be recommended a song by genre. You will then enter the game page and we will see how well you know the song and its lyrics. You will type in individual words, and the page will populate if your inputs are correct! You will be scored based on how many words you can recall and a scaled difficulty - how common the word is in english and how many times the lyric appears in the song. If you need a hint to jog your memory, we have a button for that! If you really want to quit, we have a button for that too! At the end of the game, you can share your score with your friends and if you would like, try a different song! If you create and sign in to an account, we will keep track of the songs you have played and your scores!</p>
